what does everything do:
	Check Data
		Hover
		Collision
	Update Data
		Add/Sub Voxel
		Generate
	Render Data
		Data changed
		Neighbour changed
		Info
	Static Stuff



I feel like with some of there parts
it would be easier to start over
instead of trying to change the already esisting stuff

but right now I dont really feel motivated to do that
especially since I am doing the other project right now
although I am not sure what to do in the other project right now
